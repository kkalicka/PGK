introductions to projects in this repository

Hello, welcome to the introduction of my project for lab 1!

I took my references mostly from "lab01.pdf".
This is a small program that allows you to draw a few figures on blank, dark background. Using this program you can some shapes such as circles, lines and rectangles.

Immediately after running the program, you need to choose one of the following figures:

->rectangle without filling (by pressing "R" on your keyboard)
->rectangle with filling (it is the default option, or after choosing other shapes you can press "F" on your keyboard)
->circle without filling (by pressing "C" on your keyboard)
->line (by pressing "L" on your keyboard)

also by pressing "D" on your keyboard you can increase or decrease (while pressing "O") the size of the drawing circle (if after pressing "O" or "D" you will press "C").
you can also use "D" and "O" on your keyboard to change the rotation of the drawing line (if after "O" or "D" you will press "L")

To draw chosen shape just press the left mouse button in any place on the window.

Have fun!
